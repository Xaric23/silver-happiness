# Transformation and Defeat System Guide

## Overview

The Dark Fantasy Fort Management RPG features a comprehensive transformation system where characters can be permanently altered through combat defeats, failed encounters, and magical events. This guide explains how transformations work and their consequences.

---

## Transformation Mechanics

### How Transformations Occur

1. **Combat Defeat** - When you lose in combat, enemies may transform you
2. **Failed Encounters** - Losing social, magical, or other encounters
3. **Quest Failures** - Some quest failures can trigger transformations
4. **Voluntary Transformation** - Using Arcane Labs (future feature)

### Transformation Probability

The chance of being transformed on defeat depends on:
- **Enemy Species**: Some species are more likely to transform (Demons: 150%, Shapeshifters: 160%, Fae: 140%)
- **Encounter Difficulty**: Higher difficulty = higher transformation risk (10% per difficulty level)
- **Your Corruption**: Higher corruption may increase transformation chance
- **Enemy Subspecies**: Certain subspecies have unique transformations

### Example Transformation Chances

| Enemy Type | Difficulty 5 | Difficulty 8 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Human | 50% | 80% |
| Demon (Succubus) | 75% | 120% (capped at 100%) |
| Shapeshifter | 80% | 128% (capped at 100%) |
| Fae | 70% | 112% (capped at 100%) |
