## Transformation Mechanics

### How You Get Body Parts

1. **Combat Defeat** - Random body part from winning enemy's species
2. **Failed Encounter** - Probability based on difficulty and enemy species
3. **Quest Failure** - Some failed quests give body parts
4. **Voluntary** (Future) - Arcane Lab transformations

### Probability

Body part transformation chance on defeat:
- Base: Difficulty × 10%
- Species Multiplier:
  - Demons: 1.5x
  - Shapeshifters: 1.6x
  - Fae: 1.4x
  - Vampires: 1.3x
  - Undead: 1.2x
  - Others: 1.0x

Example: Losing to a Difficulty 7 Succubus = 7 × 10% × 1.5 = 105% (capped at 100%)

### Replacement vs Addition

- **Single Slots** (ears, tail, wings, etc.): New part replaces old one
- **Multiple Slots** (scales, fur): New parts add to existing ones

### Stat Stacking

All body parts stack their bonuses:
```
Human Base: Brawn 5, Intrigue 5
+ Cat Ears: +2 Intrigue, +1 Seduction
+ Cat Tail: +1 Intrigue, +1 Survival
+ Demon Horns: +2 Arcane, +1 Seduction, +1 Intrigue
